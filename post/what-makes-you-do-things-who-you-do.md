# What makes you do things how you do?

I'm a Uncle Bob follower, I've read the most representative books from him Clean Code and Clean Coder (if you never read those, you have to), and days ago, he wrote and polemical tweet https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1010152980988026881 then a lot of people went over his throat, I'm not going to argue if was wrong, is not the point now, but, then Johannes wrote this post on his blog 
[Forget about clean code let's embrace compassionate code](http://johannesbrodwall.com/2018/06/24/forget-about-clean-code-lets-embrace-compassionate-code) I read it and I thought. I don't really understand what he means. Why is he cuestionating his principles? that makes me thing, What makes you do things how you do?

I try to be a clean coder not because the uncle bob wrote a book, I try to follow the clean code principles not because I like Uncle bob, I follow those because that makes my work better and easier and that's it.

When You see bad code from your coworkers, you have 2 choises or feel angry or feel happy, you have that desicion and no one else, Usually when I see bad code I feel happy because in that momment I have the oportunity to help, I have the oportunity to share what I've learn in the last years.

Obiously I feel angry if after several attempts to explain the better way to do something, but is not just against my coworker also against me, because maybe I'm not teachin well or probably I don't understand the idea at all. But again, thats my reaction. Clean Code can teach you how to react, because its not the intention.

Let's think in this scenario, imagin that someone invented the better way to create electricity we start to use it and we see that that is helping to save the world, then this guy fall into maddnes, and kill many people. Is that a reason to stop using the invent? Of course not. Because the invent helps.

Is like TDD, why do you use TDD, because it's trendy? Because the people says is the best way to perform code? if the answer is yes, then stop use it, you do not really understand why is importan and the benefits of use it, when you follow something that you don't trust and you don't believe, soon or later will bites you.

For me, Uncle Bob is one of the best tech writers and nothing will changes that, and for me he probably is the worst politics writer and I'll never read a book that he writes regarding politics. Like my boss says, "It is what it is compadre".

At the end, learn, use and practice, what makes you be better because that's your principles but, if your principles depends of the behavior of other person, then those aren't yours.
