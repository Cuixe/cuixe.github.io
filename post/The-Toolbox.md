# Every Developer needs a Toolbox

As same as carpenter, gardener or mechanic has a toolbox, a developer needs a toolbox.

Our toolbox is not like other toolbox, I mean we don't have a real box with hammers, screwdrivers, and pincers, our toolbox is quite different.

## What is a developer toolbox?

A toolbox for developers is a set of tools that help us do our job and the better you use your tools, the better you will do your job.

## The basic tools on your toolbox

So let's list the basics tools that every developer has to have in their toolbox

### Editor

Of course every developer needs some software to write the code it can be from text editor like notepad, vi command or sublime editor until the most sophisticated IDE's like the Intellij, Eclipse, Visual Studio Enterprise, etc.

I'm not going to say which is better because what works for me probably not works for others, the rule about editors is how easy you use them, how fast you can codify and if really help you to improve your job.

In my own case, when I write java code I use Intellij, I used to use Eclipse and Netbeans before that, but now I feel so comfortable using Intellij, I use a lot of default shortcuts and I have created my own shortcuts, but when I write code with nodejs, python or c ++ I use Visual Studio Code, because it's incredibly easy to configure it and so flexible has so many plugins (now I'm using it to write this lines).

**But is not about to use the most incredible, expensive of customized editor is about how well you can use it.**

### API's

Doesn't matter what programing language you use, you should know the API, doesn't means you have to have all the documentation in your head, of course not, but you should have enough knowledge about. why?

I've seen code that took a long time to be develop that could be replaced by a call to some API function, watchout I'm not talking about a external libraries or frameworks, no, I'm talking about a simple function inside of the API and probably the implementation in the API is much more efficient than the developer implementation.

### Frameworks and Libraries

Now I'm talking about the external libraries and frameworks made by developers outside the team that create the language API.

the more libraries and frameworks you know, you can make better decisions about when use one or when use other, even not to create something that already exists form scratch. But you only can take that kind or decisions when you really knows them. It is not enough to run an example of HelloWorld to consider yourself an expert, of course not, you must have the ability to understand why it was created, when you can use it but **more important when you should not use it**

I've seen software that only uses libraries or frameworks for fashion and the project turns out to be a failure because they force the design to fit into it. So, far from helping, they only hinder work

### Patterns

There are so many types of patterns, [Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), [architecture patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern), [integration patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Integration_Patterns) and so on, is good to know that exist, but the design patterns must be in your toolbox. It is not completely necessary to know how to implement them all, but you must know how they works. 

Is not necessary know how to implement them because is highly probable that exist an implementation in some place but if you should know what look for

### Testing tools

Has been write lots of books about this topic and is for good reasons, the better you can test your code before deliver, better it will work in real world.

You need to understand what a [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) is all about, all the testing levels, because when you knows that, you can chose the best tool for the level you want to try.


I can write a lot about this topic, the benefits of testing software code, how cool is deliver software with zero bugs and so on but this topic deserves a dedicated post (and probably more than one).

### Programing technics and methodologies

This is other huge topic.

You have to know what [Test-driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is and who helps you to improve your job and why deserves a special place in your toolbox, 
Also how [Extreme programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) can be helpful when you have no idea about the business you want to help with your code.

You have to know about the [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) yeah maybe is one of the most older and currently useless methodology but you need to know how it works and why was one of the most used and why you can not use it now (Or why you should us it).

[Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) is another topic that deserves an space in your toolbox, only because the manifesto is the base for other frameworks like [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) or [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)).

At the end, as same as libraries and frameworks as much as you have in your toolbox, you can take better decisions regarding when use it o not.

### Books, writers and blogs

Another source of good practices, learned lessons and development technics are books, blogs and the people behind them.

Is highly recommended read the **Clean Coder** and **Clean Code** by [Uncle Bob](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) , **Test-Driven Development** by [Kent Beck](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck), **Refactoring** by [Martin Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler), **The Pragmatic Programmer** by [Andy Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_(author)) and hundred more, the reason is simple,  they have more time programming than you and they faced many more problems than you.

### Conclusion

As I said from the beginning, this is a basic list of the things that a developer should have in the toolbox. And it's not about having the most expensive or specialized tools, it's about how well you know them and how well you use them, because everyone can use a hammer to create good things, but craftsman can use that hammer and create incredible things in less time.
